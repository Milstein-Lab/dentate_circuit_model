## Neural circuit regulation of plasticity and population coding in the hippocampal dentate gyrus

In this project, we construct a series of simple models of the dentate gyrus to explore how different cell types and the
distributions of connectivity between them influence population coding and information processing in the network.

Specifically, we implement the following cell populations:

- Input (from the entorhinal cortex)
- Granule cells (outputs of the network)
- Mossy cells (recurrent feedback excitation)
- Feedforward inhibition
- Feedback inhibition
